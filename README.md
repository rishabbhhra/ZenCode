Developers often work under intense pressure, juggling long hours, tight deadlines, and constant screen time.
These conditions lead to increased stress, reduced focus, and a higher risk of burnout.
This not only affects productivity but also takes a serious toll on overall mental well-being.
What we’ve built is just the beginning of a smarter, healthier, and more intuitive typing experience.
ZenCode is evolving into more than just a tool—it's shaping up to become your personal productivity and wellness companion.
Our vision is to create an intelligent typing companion that evolves with each user—enhancing well-being, focus, and skill development across all levels of expertise.
